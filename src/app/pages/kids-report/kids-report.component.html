That is all we can hope to fulfil for our children, and it’s the most underrated gift we can offer them. Parenting can be one of life’s greatest challenges, but it also can be one of life’s most rewarding challenges – when done with more conscious awareness. </p>

                    I created “Cosmic Compass for Kids” for parents who want to understand their children on a deeper level, so they can navigate parenting with a little more ease. As my eldest son Kai (almost 2 years old) became more independent and particular with his choices – like where to sit at the dinner table, or which pair of pants to put on, or which toy he wants to play with etc. he began to exhibit this behaviour where he would make a choice, get what he asked for, and then all of a sudden change his mind, wanting the other option – and continue changing the thing that he wanted, while simultaneously having a meltdown because he wanted every option at once… And I’m not going to lie, this behaviour has made my blood boil one too many times… But with the gift of astrology and knowing this is a manifestation of his Gemini Mars placement, which suggests a strong tendency for indecision and wanting to try every option possible, instead of reprimanding this behaviour and creating more tension and disconnect, I naturally become more patient and understanding in these moments, because I fundamentally understand the filter through which he’s experiencing life. And when you meet your child’s difficult moments with connection over and over again, this creates the foundation for a beautiful relationship between you and your child and will foster the necessary environment for them to thrive as their unique selves.
                    
                     
                    
                    This is one small example of how Astrology has transformed how I show up as a mother and has deepened my connection with Kai. My goal in creating <i>The Cosmic Compass for Kids</i> is to support your parenting journey, and to transform how you show up in your role as a parent through empowering you with the fundamental knowledge of who your child truly is. I want the next generation of children to become the unique individuals they were born to be, and to foster deeper parent-child connections. </p>
